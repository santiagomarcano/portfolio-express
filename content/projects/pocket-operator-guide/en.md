[PO-33 Guide](https://po33guide.com) is an interactive open source guide for the pocket sampler PO-33 K.O (launched in 2018 by the Swedish company Teenage Engineering.)

This guide is part of a proposal to encourage the digial music community and its enthusiasts.

The interface of the guide takes the form of the PO-33 K.O and each button provides an explanation of its function within the device. Everything about this small but powerful sampler is explained in a simple way so even its newest users can start to create music as soon as possible.

This project is developed in JavaScript ES6, HTML5 and CSS3
